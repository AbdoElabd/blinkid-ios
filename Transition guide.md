## 1.1.0

- No backwards incompatible changes. See Release notes for new features.

## 1.0.1

- No backwards incompatible changes

### Transition to 1.0.0

- If you're using direct API, just delete all calls to `PPCoordinator initializeRecognizers` and `PPCoordinator terminateRecognizers`. These calls are now performed internally

- `rotatedImage` property of `PPImageMetadata` no longer exists. Use `image` property instead, it correctly handles rotation.

- `PPApp` class is no longer a part of the API. 

- `PPMetadataSettings` was cleaned up - use the alternative names provided listed in the header file. 

## 0.9.6

- No backwards incompatible changes

## 0.9.5

- No backwards incompatible changes

## 0.9.4

- No backwards incompatible changes

### Transition to 0.9.3

- This version uses a new license key format. If you had a license key generated prior to v0.9.3, contact us so we can regenerate the lincense key for you.

- UK Driver's license support added. To scan them, add PPUkdlRecognizerSettings to `settings.scanSettings`

```objective-c
[settings.scanSettings addRecognizerSettings:[[PPUkdlRecognizerSettings alloc] init]];
```
  
- To collect UKDL results, look for `PPUkdlRecognizerResult` object in `scanningViewController:didOutputResults:` callback

```objective-c
for (PPRecognizerResult *result in results) {
        if ([result isKindOfClass:[PPUkdlRecognizerResult class]]) {
                PPUkdlRecognizerResult* ukdlResult = (PPUkdlRecognizerResult*)result;
                [self processUkdlResult:ukdlResult scanningViewController:scanningViewController];
        }
}
```

- `PPCoordinator` class now exposes fewer public methods and properties.

### Transition to 0.9.2

- Classes representing scanning results were renamed. Renaming was performed to match naming convention of `PPRecognizerSettings` hierarcy: now each `PPRecognizerSettings` class has it's matching `PPRecognizerResult`. Replace all existing references to old class names with the new ones:

	- `PPBaseResult` was renamed to `PPRecognizerResult`. 
	
- `PPOcrResult` (class representing a result of the OCR process, with individual characters, lines and blocks), was renamed to `PPOcrLayout`. Name change was introduced to further distinguish the class from `PPRecognizerResult` classes.

- Remove all references to `updateScanningRegion` method since it's now being called automatically in `setScanningRegion setter`.

### Transition to 0.9.1

- Framework was renamed to MicroBlink.embeddedframework. Remove the existing .embeddedframwork package from your project, and drag&drop MicroBlink.embeddedframework in the project explored of your Xcode project.

- If necessary, after the update, modify your framework search path so that it points to the  MicroBlink.embeddedframework folder.

- Main header of the framework was renamed to `<MicroBlink/Microblink.h>`. Change all references to previous header with the new one.

- method `[PPCoordinator isPhotoPaySupported]` was renamed to `[PPCoordinator isScanningSupported]`. Change all occurances of the method name.
